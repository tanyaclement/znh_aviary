2757.859455	2757.859455	I was collecting folk material for Columbia University as part of the Barnard College, Columbia University.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
2765.41131	2765.41131	What is the song called?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
2766.756756	2766.756756	They call it Gonna see my long-haired babe and it's a railroad spiking song and the rhythm is kept with a spike and a hammer.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
2776.912699	2776.912699	Will you try to emphasize, give me the approximate rhythm of the hammer with the stick by hitting it against that?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert

2887.933653	2887.933653	I see you, you seem to be hitting down twice for a hammer. Why is that?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
2894.357071	2894.357071	Uh, the men face each other with hammers and they call on each other; they're breasted, they stand breast to breast and one comes down and the other one comes down.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
2902.950561	2902.950561	Immediately afterwards?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
2903.688386	2903.688386	Yes, one comes down [strike, strike]	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
2906.596284	2906.596284	I see [strike, strike] and how long is that between the double strikes?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
2912.325278	2912.325278	The minute that one goes down, the other is on the upstroke and comes right down behind it.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
2916.318213	2916.318213	And who does the singing?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
2917.70706	2917.70706	They sing in line. It's a man who doesn't work at all. And he walks up and down and gives the rhythm for the people to work.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
2925.258916	2925.258916	Is this for a whole crew of men?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
2926.908171	2926.908171	A whole crew of men singing this one time and the railroad has to pay the singing liner or else the men won't work.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
2934.763837	2934.763837	What I'm asking you is if you hear that you only hear the one man singing on a whole section of track.	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
2940.536232	2940.536232	Not all the time, because different ones have verses they want to put in themselves and so they jump in and after they start the song but the singing liner always starts it.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
2948.825912	2948.825912	Well now look, uh, the only thing is that you were giving a long piece of singing without the rhythm of the hammer and I want to know approximately how often that comes.	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
2958.374235	2958.374235	Well, they often do that and then after that they [distortion] get in there but they [distortion]	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston

2988.104241	2988.104241	I got this in 1935. I don't remember the man's name who sung it to me but I got it at Callahan. It's a railroad camp.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
2996.95814	2996.95814	What kind of song is it?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
2998.43379	2998.43379	This is not exactly a song. It's a chant for the men lining. You know a railroad rail weighs 900 pounds and the men have to take these lining bars and get it in shape to spike it down. And while they're doing that why they have a chant that, uh, and also some songs that they be used to, the rhythm to work it into place and then the boss hollers 'Bring 'em a hammer gang' and they start to spike it down. And this is a chant for lining the rail.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston

3056.852165	3056.852165	Alright. The lining bar. When they work but don't you hear the clink of it?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3061.71313	3061.71313	It's a 'hah'! Now you don't hear the lining bar because it's under the rail and they shove the rail with it.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3067.962941	3067.962941	They hit against it?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3068.483759	3068.483759	No, it's under it. You see, it's just like on this. It's a crow bar.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3072.737102	3072.737102	Because over in Mississippi, they showed me by hitting the thing. They said that the way that they did it was by several men taking a short hit.	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3081.460797	3081.460797	Well, I've seen them put it between their legs this way and put it back and they get this, this splange under the rail, and then they 'heh, heh'. You know, like that.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3090.455752	3090.455752	Well, now what do they do? Are they pulling it, pulling it --	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3092.669226	3092.669226	Pulling it backwards, they're moving it backwards.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3093.97127	3093.97127	In other words, they have it underneath and they're using the lever to go forward.	Transcription	Herbert Halpert

3099.211998	3099.211998	Alright.	Transcription	Herbert Halpert

3103.921057	3103.921057	Oh, some time it's about 7 or 8 on at one time.	Transcription	Herbert Halpert

3230.73161	3230.73161	This song they called 'Shove it Over' and it's the lining rhythm pretty generally distributed all over Florida. It was sung to me by Charlie Jones on a railroad construction camp in Lakeland, Florida.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3243.734785	3243.734785	About how long ago?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert

3360.391837	3360.391837	This is again for lining?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3362.063673	3362.992472	This is a lining rhythm.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3362.992472	3365.546667	Now where is the movement?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3365.500227	3371.351655	When they say Shacka-lacka-lacka like they are getting ready to pull back and when they say 'heh' they shove the rail over.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3371.351655	3375.113288	In other words, this song gives them quite a lot of rest in between.	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3375.066848	3376.599365	Right a lot of rest in between.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3376.552925	3377.342404	And a harder shove?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3377.295964	3380.128798	And a harder shove at the end. And they say 'heh', they all go.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3380.175238	3385.562268	It seems to have had a different effect from the other lining one you gave, I mean that one about Mobile.	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3385.469388	3395.639728	Yes, but someone was short and someone only just come to the mood of the liner. And the men work whatever song he sung, they work that rhythm.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3395.686168	3438.503764	Uh, now when the men are lining, they put the rail down, and then of course the captain, he's crouched straddle of it and uh, looks down it so he can tell when it's lined up in exact line with the others. And if they carry it, well he'll say shove it over and if they carry it too far, he'll say send it back and when they get it exactly in line, he'll tell em 'join it ahead' but then they corrupted that to 'join ahead' and all of them say 'join ahead' for 'join it ahead'. And, uh, so, uh, this song is about a lining and the rhythm goes with, they put this lining bar, this long steel bar, crow bar, between their legs so they have greater purchase and pull back on it.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3438.503764	3441.615238	Well, wait a minute. They pull back . . . and how are they facing in relation to the rail.	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3441.568798	3444.448073	Their back is to the rail.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3444.448073	3447.327347	In other words, they're pulling up on the bar.	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3447.327347	3452.110658	They're pulling up on the bar. They don't have to look at the rail because that's the captain's job to see when it's right.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3452.157098	3455.640091	Well, what do they do? Do they, how do they get it under the bar, the rail?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3455.686531	3460.376961	They just push the flange of this lining bar under the rail and then pull back on it.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3460.330522	3462.977596	Do they have to look back at it or do they just feel it?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3462.931156	3469.757823	Oh, they can just feel it. Sometimes they look back, you know, but most of them, they just can feel it and they send it back on there.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
3469.711383	3479.974603	Well, uh, you were saying, you were explaining that there's different rhythms that they have. Are there any particular times when a faster on or a slower one would be used?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
3479.928163	3507.513469	Well, it's different; it's not any particular time except just the feeling of the singing liner. Whatever song he starts. If it's a fast rhythm they work fast; if its's a slow one, well they work, you know, a little slower but they get just as much work done, it seems, somehow or another.
