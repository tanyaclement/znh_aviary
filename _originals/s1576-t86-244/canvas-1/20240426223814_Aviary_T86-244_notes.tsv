29:45:00	29:45:00	Well, this story was told to me two years ago by one of the heirs to the Reed Plantation, Mulberry Grove, which is just south of Jacksonville. She said that right after the war when the slaves were freed she gave, she told Mariah the cook of her freedom and gave her the house at the end of the field to live in. So Mariah and all of her children set out and the youngest and the tiniest at the end of the line would fall down and get up, fall down again and get up.  So Mrs. Pearson called to Mariah and said, 'You're losing one of your children, Mariah'. And Mariah turned back and said, 'You can have that one, Miss. Pearson, if you wants it.' That's all.

326.652893	333.626033	Uh, this story happened during the fall of 1898 upon a small island off of the coast of Georgia	Transcription	Beatrice Lange
334.207128	343.155992	Where the sea level was very low. Came a hurricane which covered the whole island in several feet of water and most of the natives had to swim around in their homes.	Transcription	Beatrice Lange
343.543388	350.40031	One particular instance which calls to mind is that of an old negrum owned by one of the early rice planters.	Transcription	Beatrice Lange
351.252583	362.332128	He tells: Yes sir, we were swimming around in that water trying to find a shallow place when we seen some of them pretty long neck bottles floating around. Look like them water in 'em.	Transcription	Beatrice Lange
362.874483	376.510847	So we drink some and before long we was glad to have some been come because it sure made us feel good. Sure wish I could have some of that stuff now. Boss, I believe that been shampoo.	Transcription	Beatrice Lange
377.556818	382.166839	Further on the flooded plantation, the boss paddled his canoe up to the loft of the barn.	Transcription	Beatrice Lange
382.554236	401.497934	There sat another of his n-- with a big stick in his hand as if he was going to strike something. Even that the hole in the side of the barn where the [inaudible] was stored had looked as if a board had been torn off. He glanced over in the corner and there'n a pile of dead coons which looked like a hundred or so.	Transcription	Beatrice Lange
401.497934	433.57438	As the boss approached, he said, 'By grade, Tom, what have you been doing here?' He replied in a dramatic voice, 'Boss, I's just been praying all the time, how's that good for the ole master to come take this water back where it belong so we's could get back to work. Boss, I've been a praying every chance that I'm got to liberation.' 'Well, from the looks of the coons you killed, you didn't have time to pray much, Tom'. 'Mass Donald,  I wouldn't have killed 'em but they kept barring me from praying all the time.'	Transcription	Beatrice Lange

505.036677	625.442772	Surely, but I have to give all that other data.  My name is Zora Neale Hurston and I'm going to sing a gambling song that I collected at Boston Florida. Turpentine is still there. And the men are playing a game called Georgia Skin. That's the most favorite gambling scheme among the workers of the South. And they lose money on the drop of a card, the fall of a card. And there's a rhythm to the fall of the card and after they get set with the two principles and the other people are called pikers and anybody that wants a special card, he pick it out and they call that, uh, picking one in the rough.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
550.645661	556.766529	I think it's better if you explain just how the cards, which way the cards get out or how people are standing there before you go on.	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
557.153926	557.153926	Well, you see, they take a deck of cards and they shuffle it real good and watch the man to be sure he don't steal nothing. That is, that he don't set a cub. There are four cards of every kind in the deck. And when the card like the card you have selected falls, you lose. Sometimes if you don't watch the dealer he'll put three cards just like his own down at the bottom of the deck so that everybody falls before he does and then he wins all the money.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
581.792355	581.792355	Well, what does he do? Is the dealer holding the deck of cards?	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
584.969008	584.969008	And he puts it on the table. They don't allow him to hold it because they're afraid he'll steal.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
588.30062	588.30062	Alright.	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
588.920455	588.920455	So they, he puts it on the table and he turns over a card.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston
592.019628	592.019628	He just turns over . . .	Transcription	Herbert Halpert
593.259298	593.259298	Card by card and if the card is just like yours, when it falls, you lose. And, uh, so they holler when he gets all set, when the principles has got their cards and the pikers has got theirs and then the man will say he wants them to put the bets down and he'll say 'Put the money on the wood, and make the bet go good and then again, put it insight and save a fight' and so they all get the bets down and then he start and they'll holler, 'Let the deal go down, boys, let the deal go down'.  And someone will start singing.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston

No matter where you go you can find verses of Uncle Bud. And, uh, it's a favorite song.

I just get in the crowd with the people if they singing and I listen as best I can and I start to joining in with a phrase or two and then finally I get so I can sing a verse and then I keep on until I learn all the songs, all the verses, and then I sing them back to the people until they tell me that I can sing them just like them and then I take part and I try it out on different people who already know the song until they are quite satisfied that I know it and then I carry it in my memory.

1407.838326	1427.479339	This one. Some of them call it 'Po Boy' and some of them call it 'Po Gal' but it's a pretty well-distributed blues tune all over the South. The words are not rhymed. It's a typical Negro pattern. The same line repeated three times with a sort of flip line on the end and the change is in the tune rather than the words for the most part.

1595.067923	1621.487603	Mama Don't Want No Peas No Rice' is a song from Nassau in the Bahama islands. They are great song makers and their tunes are decidedly more African than the ones made by the negroes in America. They make songs so rapidly they say 'Anything you do we put you in sing'. And in a few hours they have a song about it. Mama don't want no peas no rice is about a woman who wanted to stay drunk all the time and her husband is really complaining about it. He's explaining to the neighbors what's the matter with his wife and why they don't get along better.	Transcription	Zora Neale Hurston

1891.662598	1934.039256	Rolla Southworth: Well, Dr. Corse it would really seem that we have finally grown up as a nation when we can spend the day recording such folklore as we have heard today. And this is only the beginning and in only one city. Think of the endless material alone throughout Florida. Now although we are in the deep South, our state, with Mr. Call, has a very cosmopolitan group. As a matter of fact, the flags of five nations have flown over Florida. Isn't that a fact? And what a wealth of material that will indicate. Personally, my greatest interest is in the Negro Folklore and how justly proud we all are of Zora Hurston whose fine literary ability and wealth of experience has made our recordings possible today.
